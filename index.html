            Hi! My name is Gabriel Mixon and I'm 18 years old. I attended and graduated from Durham School of the Arts in 2019. My art pathway at DSA was the violin, and I have been playing for 8 years. During highschool I also performed with the Duke University String School, ending as a 1st violinist in the youth symphony.

            Currently I am employed as a landscaper for Tributary Land Design + Build. I worked for them during the summer of 2018 and now I am working for them full-time. I enjoy working in landscaping and learning new skills.
